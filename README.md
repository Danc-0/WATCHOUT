A jetpack compose App consuming the STAR WARS API(Swapi) to help provide information about various aspects of STAR WARS

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate below:
  - Working with the Star Wars API.
  - Implementing UI components with Jetpack Compose.
  - Implementation of Android architecture components with Jetpack libraries such as Hilt and Paging in Compose.
  - Handling threading with Kotlin Coroutines.
  - Handling different Modes(Dark/Light)

### Structural design pattern
The app is built with clean Architecture in mind leveraging structural pattern of MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) where separation of concerns is key. The app consists of 3 layers
- WATCHOUT follow the official architecture guidance by Google
- With this approach each layer or package in the app has a different role/responsibility and sole reason is following the UDF(Unidirectional Data Flow)
- Architecture overview
  - DATA LAYERS - consists of repositories, which has the logics for accessing the data from the remote database or network with a principle of single source of truth.
  - DOMAIN LAYER - Is where all the business logic is, and acts as the bridge between DATA and PRESENTATION
  - PRESENTATION LAYER - Entails the UI elements that users can interact with and consists of viewModels that helps in managing the configuration changes
